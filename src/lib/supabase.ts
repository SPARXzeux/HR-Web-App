// This file previously contained the Supabase client used during the

// This file is kept as a stub to avoid breaking any stray imports while the
// codebase is being cleaned up. The supabase export below is intentionally
// a no-op object — nothing in the active codebase reads from it.
//
// TODO: once all call sites have been confirmed removed, delete this file and
// remove @supabase/supabase-js from package.json.

  // Stub — not connected. Use src/lib/pocketbase.ts (pb) instead.
